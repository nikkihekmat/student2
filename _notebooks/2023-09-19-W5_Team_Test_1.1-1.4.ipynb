    "\n",
    "What are the benefits of a team? Explain some of the diveristies that your team has to offer.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- A team can complete larger projects at a faster rate because members can be assigned different tasks. A team can also be beneficial by compiling people with different strengths in order to achieve an end goal. Our team exemplifies this via our diversities, which come together to help us accomplish our projects because we can play to each others' strenths and weaknesses.\n",
    "        \n",
    "- Each member of our team uses their individuality to serve a particular purpose. Monika already has an extensive background in computer science, so she is a resource when our other members have pressing questions or are unable to solve bugs on thier own. We've also appointed her as the backend developer because of her depth in knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ankit is also more knowledgeable in CS, so we've appointed him as another developer (for frontend). He acts as a second reliable resource if Monika is unsure about something.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Varun does well in examining code already developed. If Ankit or Monika find a bug, he is able to utilize outside resources to pinpoint the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, Nikki is least knowledgeable in CS, though her addition to the team comes in her ability to lead the team as Scrum Master. She delegates tasks, organizes meetings outside of school, and keeps the team foused and collaborating. \n",
    "\n",
    "Describe how you will facilitate communication amongst group members.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will facilitate communication amongst group members with two main channels: a Slack group chat and an iMessage group chat. This will allow us to commumicate outside of class if there is unfinished work we need to catch up on. Another method is joining group Zoom calls so that it's easier to understand each others' ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An important part of faciiating communication that we will implement is respecting each other. We will aim to be attentive listeners and uplift each other if someone is having more trouble understanding the code. We will also commit to asking each other for help when needed so that one group member doesn't fall behind. \n",
    "\n",
    "How will you hold each person accountable for their portion of the work? Think about dates, review tickets, and peer revies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The Scrum Master will be the main person to hold members accountable for their portion of the work, as the Scrum Master is also in charge of delegating tasks. The Scrum Master will check in with members each day to ensure the group is staying on task. If a member is having trouble staying on top of their work, the Scrum Master will have a respectful conversation with that individual. They will also assign deadlines for each member to meet."
