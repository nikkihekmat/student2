    "- Metadata: specifies information about the original data which assists in identifying the nature and features of that data\n",
    "- Data is a set of raw facts that help identify useful information when they are cleaned, processed, and organized. Metadata, on the other hand, is data about data\n",

    "- Byte pair encoding: a data encoding technique. The encoding algorithm looks for pairs of characters that appear in the string more than once and replaces each instance of that pair with a corresponding character that does not appear in the string. The algorithm saves a list containing the mapping of character pairs to their corresponding replacement characters.\n",
