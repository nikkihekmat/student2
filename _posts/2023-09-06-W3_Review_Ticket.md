# Pair Showcase Outline

## Live Review 2
- Briefly show use of theme in blog and personalization of timebox (i.e. my notes) and daily plans
- Will show experiments and learnings in Python, including Jupyter Notebook(s) as Hacks/Tangible

## Pair Showcase
- Will showcase my blog and the different pages, explaining how I troubleshooted and figured out how to fix weird problems with layout on my own (through much exploration/research)
    - Faced unique problems, used my resources (internet, partner, teacher, extra time after school and office hours)
    - My minor goals for the past 2 weeks: accomplishing baby steps to fix technical issues
- Technical progress: added complexity to home page (more images) and Time Box notes
- Will use this as a time to demo key technicals described in hacks
- Will show personalized use of Python, HTML, and Linux Bash in Pair Showcase Notebook with partner



Bring tickets and tangibles into GitHub pages repo on your Time Box page.
