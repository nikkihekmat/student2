## Memories and Learnings

- great collaboration with team, learned how to communicate effectively with a larger group versus the pair stage
- learned some beginner python and html from the student lessons

## Positive Accomplishments

- finished a passion project in 3 weeks

## Things I Intend to Learn in Future Trimesters & Room for Growth

- I intend to learn how to adapt to a different scrum team
- I intend to learn more coding knowledge and build off of the things I learned from the student lessons

## Passion Project Reflection

Our group worked diligently to get our project done. We faced many minor issues, where code wouldn't work or formatting was jumbled, or something wouldn't commit from our frontend to our local host properly. But we battled these problems together, consulted resources like ChatGPT and improved the code it gave us.

We put in much dedication to the project, from our **4-hour Zoom call** sorting problems the night before the project was due, to working tirelessly during free class periods.

One thing that showed good coordination was not only the communication between our backend deveoper and our frontend developers, but the communal effort it took to finish the database. We logged 95 books in Supabase ourselves. As Scrum Master I delegated the work so that we could finish the database on time for the project's due date.

Overall I think the project was a good experience, and I did learn a great deal from it. I learned how to communicate effectively, manage my time accordingly, delegate tasks, keep people on track, use outside resources, and not to mention learned to apply a bit of coding knowledge. I did struggle with JavaScript because I wasn't familiar with the langauge, so I used a code from chatGPT and put my own spin on it.
