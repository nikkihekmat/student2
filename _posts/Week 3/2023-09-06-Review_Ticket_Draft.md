# Showcase Plan Draft

(10 seconds) Nikki and Monika: Introductions

(1:15) Nikki:
- Will showcase my blog and the different pages, explaining how I troubleshooted and figured out how to the fix weird problems with layout on my own (through much exploration/research)
- Will use this as a general time of me facing unique problems and how I used my resources (internet, partner, teacher, extra time after school and office hours) to overcome them
    - Want to also explain that I’ve had minor goals thus far of accomplishing baby steps to fix technical issues I’ve been having
- Will try to brainstorm a larger project to work on in the near future
- To show technical progress I will try to add some complexity to my home page and the daily plans in my Time Box. I’ll try to include more sections, more images (maybe a collage), more personal information on my home page, etc.
- Will use markdown/code cell lesson and use the given html to make a personalized table in a topic I like (maybe a system where I rate my favorite books?) and showcase that
- Will use this as a time to demo key technicals described in hacks
- Need to do these two things before showcase:
    - Build a review ticket in Time Box page to accelerate discussion.
    - Bring tickets and tangibles into GitHub pages repo on your Time Box page.

(1:15) Monika:
- I will showcase what I have done with my blog and explain how I got it to work the way it does

(20 seconds) Nikki and Monika: Conclusion/Wrap Up, time to answer follow up questions
