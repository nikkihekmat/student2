# Overall
- refer to hacks of each assignment for great examples of content absorbed 
- This page is more of a summary of each lesson because I learn better by knowing the general information of something and then seeing the examples in depth first hand. For me all the content in the student lessons was valuable to me, so I can't really pull apart the most important things to remember.

## Algorithms
- can type in standard mathematical operations with some twists 

## Boolean If
- true/false operation 
- learned how to call back to operators 
- learned how to establish simple conditionals

## Developing Algorithms
- can use algorithms to organize lists

## DTMA
- binary and sequential search 
- if/else statemnts

## Developing Procedures
- sorting things into classes

## Libraries
- libraries are stored modules of data that you have to download in order to call upon
- one example is calling upon operations from a math library 


## Simulations 
- algorithmic efficiency 
- dice roll
- different types of quick counting
