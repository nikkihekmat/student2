## Reflection 

We spent a lot of time on our Student Teach--a collective 3 hour Zoom call over the weekend plus outside time planning and polishing our presentation and homework assignment. According to the original instructions of the assignment, we planned out the period well.

The actual flow of our presentation was great. We made sure to fit in time for popcorn hacks, questions, and if we needed to slow down the explanation of any concept. We included thorough examples, which led to better comprehension for our audience. 

Overall I think we did fairly well for being cut off at the ened, because most people turned in very well-executed homework hacks.

The only thing I would change from the experience is how Mr. Mortensen handled it. Things should have been communicated better to our team--that would have resulted in students and our group not being flustered at the rushed end of the presentation.
